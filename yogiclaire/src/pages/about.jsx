        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Yoga is more than just physical postures; it's a holistic practice that connects body, mind, and spirit, 
        bringing balance and harmony in a chaotic world. As a teacher, I believe yoga is a transformative tool, 
        inviting us to breathe deeply, move mindfully, and explore our inner selves with compassion. It fosters 
        both personal growth and a sense of community, reminding us of our shared humanity and interconnectedness. 
        Ultimately, yoga is a journey toward greater awareness, peace, and purpose in life</p>
